Programs must be written for people to read, and only incidentally for machines to execute.
Always code as if the guy who ends up maintaining your code will be a violent psychopath who knows where you live.
Programming  today  is  a  race  between  software  engineers  striving  to  build  bigger  and  better  idiot-proof programs, and the Universe trying to produce bigger and better idiots. So far, the Universe is winning.
Any  fool  can  write  code  that  a  computer  can  understand.  Good  programmers  write  code  that  humans  can  understand.
I am not a great programmer; I am just a good programmer with great habits.
That's the thing about people who think they hate computers. What they really hate is lousy programmers.
A language that does not affect the way you think about programming is not worth knowing.
Walking on water and developing software from a specification are easy if both are frozen.
Perl â€“ The only language that looks the same before and after RSA encryption.
The most important property of a program is whether it accomplishes the intention of its user.
You can squish a bug. You can't kill programming bugs. You can only avoid programming bugs.
The cake is a lie because someone was too lazy to program it in.
Game programming is both an incredibly lucrative thing you can do, and the most stressful thing you can do. You know you can get paid well for it, but you now know you will forever be haunted by the ghosts of angry gamers.
I like it when people remember their semicolons.
You know someone is stretching their resume when they say that they know how to program in java because they wrote a "hello world" program in it.
If the C languages are a family, than is java the single rich uncle?
I hate it when people relate human language to programming languages. You can understand a computer pretty easily. Understanding a person is much harder.
Computers always have a reason why something fails. We humans aren't given such an out. You see, this way, we can blame a computer for not working. Managers don't know any better. Wait, no, what are you doing, don't tell the boss!
There are a million ways to screw up a program, and maybe ten ways to program it right, and probably one way to do it efficiently.
I hate sand. It's all course, and rough, and irritating. And it gets everywhere. Just like these damn bugs.
