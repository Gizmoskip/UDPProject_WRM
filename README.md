Client instructions:

It runs simply, using:

java WRMClient [IP address] [Port number]

Where IP address and port number are input as such, as initializers.

Requests you input <REQUESTQUOTE> for a random programming quote, or <EXIT> in order to close the client.


Server instructions:

java WRMServer

Runs with no initializers, but takes a port number once lauched, upon asking for one. Simple enough to run from there. Will run the server only once port number is given.

Process has to be ended in order to close the server application - not with any specific command.
